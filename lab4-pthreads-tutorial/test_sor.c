/* Imagine a long metal bar that is initially at room temperature.
   Heating and cooling devices are applied to the ends of the bar so that
   one end is kept at a constant temperature of 0 degrees, the other end
   at 100 degrees. 

   We can simulate this system with N threads, each one responsible for
   tracking the temperature at a point along the bar, with successive
   calculations representing successive points in time.

   We'll be calculating an approximate solution of the heat equation on
   a 1-dimensional grid of N+2 points. There are 2 extra points to hold
   the boundary values, which don't change.

   If N=10, the array will have 12 elements. If the boundary conditions
   (temperatures at the ends) are 0 and 100, we have:

   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  0  | t_0 | t_1 | t_2 | t_3 | t_4 | t_5 | t_6 | t_7 | t_8 | t_9 | 100 |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   where t_i are values that vary with time.

   Given the two endpoints as boundary conditions in space, and any initial
   set of values t_i, using the heat equation or diffusion equation, there is
   one solution in the limit as time goes to infinity (i.e. a steady-state
   equilibrium):

       U is a 1-D array U of temperatures

       U_i is the current temperature of the ith element at time t
       U_i' is the temperature at time t+DELTA_T

       Using a forward difference in time and a central difference in space,
       the solution to the heat equation can be approximated by

       (U_i' - U_i)/DELTA_T = (U_(i-1) - 2 U_i + U_(i+1)) / DELTA_X^2

       This calculation is similar to the SOR ("Successive Over-Relaxation")
       technique which finds the steady-state equilibrium solution for a
       system that has one.  However, this calculation is more general-purpose
       in that it can also simulate systems that have no steady-state solution.
